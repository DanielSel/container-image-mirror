# container-image-mirror
Mirror container (docker) images from a set of source registries to a set of destination registries. 

**ATTENTION: For now, this is only a quick hack to mirror dockerhub images to gcr.io. I intend to extend it in the future, but currently it supports no authentication besides Google Application Default Credentials (ADC).**
